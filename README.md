In this repository I have stored some of the most used intermediate and advanced level algorithms in competitive programming .
I have written all the codes by myself  . Before that I myself have learned these algorihms from various blog's . I have written them while maintaing strong modularity , so that when I need to remember a process or an algorithms I can do so just by looking at the codes . I have also commented in the codes where it was necessary . 

*These codes are written in way which makes them very easy to understand for a beginner or an intermediate level coder .*<br>

I strongly hope that an intermediate level programmer will benefit highly from my library , as there isn't much resources available for advanced topic's . 

I am currently in the enrichment process of my library . Hope to include almost all the algorithms used by an intermediate or an advanced level cp coder.

```c
#include<studio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Happy Coding");
    return 0;
}
```
