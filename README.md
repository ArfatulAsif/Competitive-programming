In this repository I have stored some of the most used intermediate and advanced level algorithms in competitive programming .
One can use these as  template . 

*These codes are written in way which makes them very easy to understand for a beginner or an intermediate level coder .*<br>

I am currently in the enrichment process of my library . Hope to include almost all the algorithms used by a intermediate or a advanced level cp coder.

```c
#include<studio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Happy Coding");
    return 0;
}
```
