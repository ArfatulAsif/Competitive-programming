# Dynamic Programming Road Map
While I was surfing all over the internet on how to learn Dynamic Programming , I was quite confused . Eventually I did learn how dynamic programming works .
```c
Yes I am gonna use the line "how dynamic programming works" 
You can never stop learning different dp technique as it is the hardest topic of all CP techniques
It takes years to master .
```
Here , I have described a road map which I took in learning Dynamic Programming . I think this is a very good way to get into the world of dp . 


<h3> Step - 01 : Watch Abdul Bari Sir's Video on Recursion  </h3>
It is very important to have an clear idea on how different types of recurion works . And also one should have clear idea on stack memory
and how it is accessed and cleared through recursive process .

<h3> Step - 02 : Do 50 Easy and medium problems on Recursion and Backtracking from GeeksForGeeks </h3>
Go to GFG and then go to topic wise practice and select topic Recursion and Backtracking .

<img src = "GFG Recursion and Backtracking.PNG">
Select sort by  difficulty and solve atleast 50 problems.

```c
After solving them You must have an Excellent Idea on how Recursion and Stack memory works as well as Backtracking.
```

<h3> Step - 03 : Do some Text Book Works </h3>
It is time to get yourself familiarize with DP . You know , basic definations , why dp? How dp? etc . 
You should read some blogs and articles on DP  and try to get an image on dp . 
Now You should code some of the most common and well known dp problems .

```c
1. Coin change.
2. LIS
3. LCS
4. Knapsack
5. etc....
```

Remember You are not learning dp through them , Just getting yourself ready .
If you are from Bangladesh , I also recommand that you follow shafayat's blog in this step.

<h3> Step - 04 : Solving From Atcoder Educational DP Contest .</h3>

```c
https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp
```

Almost all recent CP coders I know had started  their dp jouney from this library. 
You should solve as many as you can . If you get stuck , watch a video of Errichto From the link where he
has explained solution of all the problems.

```c
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAQxdm0bTaw
```
Now you should turn to CSES dp section . And try to solve as many as you can . If you get stuck , don't waste much time , watch the solution and move on.

```c
After this step you should have abstruct idea on how dp works . It is time to catagorize your approach 
on solving traditional dp problems . Move on to next step .
```

<h3> Step - 05 : Catagorizing your approach on solving traditional dp problems </h3>
 Follow the link . You will reach a leetcode article . Follow every details of it blindly , trust me ...
 
  ```c
  https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns#Merging-Intervals
  ```
  
  <img src = "leetcode dp.PNG">

```c
Follow it blindly , every last details of it . Trust Me 
```

<h3>Step -06 : Time to do Your own research and defining your own approch on various dp problems </h3>
You should start solving dp problems from codeforces . Remember one thing , most of the problems under 1700 rated can be solved 
using greedy even though they might have dp as tag .</br> So don't try dp on them .(or try , I think its quite your own decision )
The reason I said so is because , you have recently learned dp and you will try dp apprach even on basic greedy problems and make it 
much difficult. However this should pass away over time and maturity.

<h3> Step -07 : Learn Bitmask dp </h3>

Although it is a quite advanced technique . But I think You should learn it right away . Allmost all the problems which has
n<20 as constrain is bitmask dp . 
I thought the following article was very helpful.

```c

<h2>Step - 08 : The Most Important Step .</h2>
I am by no means expert on dp , Far from it actully .</br>
But I do know How it works while my journey through this road map . I can only hope that my writting was helpful to you 
..
If it was even a little bit helpful . 

```c
Please consider loggin in to your github and giving me a Star on my Competitive-Programming Repository.

Take care BYE .
